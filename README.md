## About

[OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev) is an open source Fine-Grained Authorization solution inspired by [Google's Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). It was created by the FGA team at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) based on [Auth0 Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)](https://fga.dev), available under [a permissive license (Apache-2)](https://github.com/openfga/rfcs/blob/main/LICENSE) and welcomes community contributions.

OpenFGA is designed to make it easy for application builders to model their permission layer, and to add and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications. OpenFGAâ€™s design is optimized for reliability and low latency at a high scale.

## Installation



## Getting Started

### Initializing the API Client

[Learn how to initialize your SDK](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-sdk-client)



### Get your Store ID

You need your store id to call the OpenFGA API (unless it is to call the [CreateStore](#create-store) or [ListStores](#list-stores) methods).

If your server is configured with [authentication enabled](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga#configuring-authentication), you also need to have your credentials ready.

### Calling the API



### API Endpoints



### Models
